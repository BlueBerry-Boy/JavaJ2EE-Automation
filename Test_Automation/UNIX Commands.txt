UNIX/LINUX:
-----------------
-----------------
operating System:An operating system (OS) is a set of programs that manage computer hardware resources and provide common services for application software. 

Windows: GUI
UNIX/LINUX: character user interface/command line

-------------------
-------------------
UNIX:
Unix operating systems are widely used in servers, workstations, and mobile devices. The Unix environment and the client–server program model were essential elements in the development of the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers.
EG: Flavors of unix :SUN-SOLARIS: (AT&T, VERIZON,) IBM-AIX, HP-UX

LINUX:
Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open source software development and distribution.
EG:REDHAT Enterprise linux - open source
------------------------
------------------------
can use cygwin, putty, or telnet -- tools to connect to linux server
refer:  putty download install.pdf
------------------------
------------------------
Tester role:
If server is down, start server
Login to the server, go to dir, check if server is up.
If server is down, run script file and check the log file for error messages.
Any error messages, email(through ftp) them to concerned person
You need to know:  How to login, go to specific dir, create small files, view the files, check the process, copy files from unix to windows os
Commands are common for all unix/linux platforms

ls: list the file names
ls -ltr: list the file names with details

Editing a file:
vi 'filename'
press i to start editing

when done with editing press ESC
then pres :  (shift ;)
then press wq to save and quit
or q! to exit without saving changes




performance tester:
top: to see cpu/memory utilization for each process
vmstat: gives the performance of server
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
File Transfer Protocol: FTP

log files: gives the lists of users connected to server and processes run by them

FTP: use ftp to Copy from unix to windows and send to developer.
ftp server: winxcp, filezilla, winftp

-----------------------------------
-----------------------------------
filezilla:
downlaod filezilla client from: http://filezilla-project.org/
host: m-net.arbornet.org
username: h2kunix6
pass:h2kunix6

to find the IP address
cmd.exe:
ping m-net.arbornet.org
ftp <IPaddress>:connects to ftp
